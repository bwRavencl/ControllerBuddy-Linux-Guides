# ControllerBuddy-Linux-Guides

## 📖 Description

This repository contains step-by-step guides for setting up various flight simulation games for use with [ControllerBuddy](https://controllerbuddy.org/) on Linux via the [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) compatibility layer provided by [Steam](https://steampowered.com/).

These guides are intended to help users set up their flight simulators to work with ControllerBuddy and integrate seamlessly into a Steam-based gaming experience on Linux systems, including the [SteamDeck](https://www.steamdeck.com).  
This includes automatically launching and stopping ControllerBuddy alongside the respective game from within Steam.

Although the guides are designed to be as straightforward as possible, they assume a basic familiarity with Linux command-line operations and the use of [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) applications.
